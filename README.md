# simple-finder-rename

Simple service for renaming items in the finder. It asks for original and replacement text then renames all matching files and folders recursively.


## Installation

1. Download this repo
2. Place the `Rename....workflow` file in the `~/Library/Services/`folder.

## Usage

You can activate the feature several different ways:

1. Right click on a Finder item at select `Rename...`
2. Right click on a Finder item then under `Quick Actions` select `Rename...`
3. In the Finder menu under `Services` select `Rename...`

Once you've activated Rename it will ask for an original string of text to replace, and then the new text you'd like as a replacement.
